        <p>Big juicy burgers filled with chilies, cheese and mushrooms, then grilled and

            When I have a cook out, and I'm making burgers, this is what my wife asks for all the time!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (10 fluid ounce) bottle steak sauce, (e.g. A-1), divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fajita seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dried minced onion</li>
            <li>8 slices American cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chiles, drained</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl,mix together the ground beef,
                1/4 cup of the steak sauce, fajita seasoning,
                and dried onion until well blended.
            </li>
            <li>Form the mixture into 8 patties.</li>
            <li>Set aside 4 of the patties. On the other 4 patties, place one slice of 
                cheese, some of the green chilies, and some mushrooms.
            </li>
            <li> Place the other 4 patties over the top, press down, 
                and seal the edges so the goodies do not escape.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat. Lightly oil grate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place patties on the grill, and let them brown on both sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once they begin to brown, brush the tops with remaining steak sauce. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue to grill for about 30 minutes, basting frequently with steak sauce, until meat is no longer pink, and the juices run clear.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the meat is ready to come off the grill, place the remaining 4 slices of cheese over the tops of the patties.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve on buns, or just by themselves.
            </li>
        </ol>
